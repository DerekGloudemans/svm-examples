# svm-examples
 For this assignment, support vector classifiers were used to classify data from a non-linearly separable toy dataset (the moons dataset from scikit-learn). Some example datasets created using this utility can be seen below.

 Grid search was used to tune the hyperparameters C and $\gamma\ for a support vector classifier.

 With a fixed value of gamma, C was adjusted to illustrate how this hyperparameter affects the complexity and overfittedness of the decision function.

 The same was done for gamma with a fixed C.
